#Summary
    The objective of the challenge was to make the webpage provided more accessible to an outside programmer while at the same time keeping the code clean. I made several changes to the index and style pages to meet these goals. 

#Index changes
    -Throughout the Index page I replaced the <div> elements with semantic elements. 
    -I also created a title that is more descriptive of what the website represents. 
    -I added alt attributes to image referrences so that there will be descriptors of the image if it fails to load.
    -Generally cleaned up the code to be more compact. 

#Style changes
    -made changes to the selectors so that they match with the new Index elements.
